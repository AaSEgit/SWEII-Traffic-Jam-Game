 Things to Keep Track of
 ------------------------------
 - current size of game board
 - unoccupied square and its position
 - last move and last moved player
 - is a move legal?
 - is a player sorted?
 - are all players sorted?


 Game Setup
 ------------------------------
 1. Get teamSize from user
 2. Create GameBoard with (2*teamSize + 1) squares
 3. Create 2 Teams of size teamSize
 4. Load 1st Team (alpha) into GameBoard squares
    - set squares to occupied
 5. Load unoccupied square in the center of GameBoard
 6. Load 2nds Team (num) into GameBoard squares
    - set squares to occupied
 7. Prompt user: "See solution or start step-by-step gameplay?"


 Automatic Gameplay Algorithm
 ------------------------------
 1. Unoccupied Square
        Search for unoccupied square on the GameBoard

 2. Check Unoccupied Square
        if index of unoccupied square == teamSize AND no moves were made yet
            check direction of choice (left or right)
        else if index of unoccupied square == 0 
            check right
        else if index of unoccupied square == GameBoard size
            check left
        else
            if last move was shift 
                check opposite direction
            else if last move was jump
                check same direction      

 3. Move to unoccupied square
        shift if possible
            - Team alpha can only shift right (current position + 1)
            - Team num can only shift left (current position - 1)
        else jump if possible
            - Team alpha can only jump right (current position + 2)
            - Team num can only jump left (current position - 2)
        else continue down direction until a legal move can be made
    
 4. Check if last moved player is sorted 
        if (teamID == "alpha" AND current position == initial position + (teamSize + 1))
            Remove it from the game board and place in final list
        else if (teamID == "num" AND current position == initial position - (teamSize + 1))
            Remove it from the game board and place in final list

 5. Loop (go back to step 1) until 2 players have been sorted

 6. Players are now alternating (alpha-num-alpha-num)
        Sort remaining players

 7. Display final list of sorted players

 8. Clear GameBoard 


 Step-by-Step Gameplay
 ------------------------------
Do
    Let user select a player
    Let user choose a move
    if move is illegal
        Reset game
Until all players are sorted
